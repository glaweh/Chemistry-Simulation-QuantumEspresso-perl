This is the README file for the QuantumEspresso perl module. It mainly consists
of parsers for output files of various tools in the Quantum Espresso suite
(http://www.quantum-espresso.org).

Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for
electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It
is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

Unfortunately, the information printed by the code are hard to parse by tools
such as sed/awk/grep.

These perl modules and utilities have been developed to ease that task a bit.

Documentation and proper install scripts are still on my TODO-list.
